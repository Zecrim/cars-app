## The App
The Wrench Collective is more than an app. The Wrench Collective is a community. A place where people can come together to share their passions. Their worries, hopes, fears, and successes. The Wrench Collective is a family of car enthusiasts coming together to share, talk about, and revel in eachother's garages and cars.

Once you sign up, you can create a garage, a wishlist, or multiple garages. In each garage you can add, remove, update, and delete cars. On each car you and other Wrench Collective members can comment on the cars. If you need to, you can update or delete your comments as necessary. In addition, if you need to change the name of your garage- perhaps you've moved to a new city or mistyped it, you can always edit or delete an entire garage.

This app was designed for people to come together and experience their cars in a community.
